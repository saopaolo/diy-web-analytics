Custom Web Analytics Tracker
Overview

This repository contains a basic example of a custom web analytics tracker, demonstrating how to collect website behavior data and send it to a server you control. The provided code tracks page views and click events, offering a foundation you can expand upon to meet your specific analytics requirements.
Use Case

Building a custom web analytics platform allows you to gain detailed insights into user behavior on your website. By using your own server for data storage and leveraging server-side analytics, you maintain full control over your data and can integrate advanced analysis tools tailored to your needs. This approach also provides the flexibility to customize tracking methods and reporting based on your specific objectives.
Features

    Page View Tracking: Automatically tracks and sends data about page views.
    Click Event Tracking: Monitors and reports user interactions with clickable elements on the page.
    Server-Side Endpoint: Example server-side code provided for handling incoming tracking data.

How It Works

    JavaScript Tracking Code: Collects data on page views and click events and sends this data to your server.
    Server-Side Endpoint: Receives and logs the tracking data. This example uses Node.js with Express but can be adapted to other server-side technologies.

JavaScript Code Example

The following JavaScript code should be included in your website to track page views and click events. Make sure to replace 'https://your-server-url.com/api/track' with the URL of your own server endpoint.
